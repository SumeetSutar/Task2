# Task2
This assignment involved carrying out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic data with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We began by creating summary statistics to comprehend the general properties of the data, like central tendency and dispersion. We plotted distributions with histograms and boxplots to detect outliers. A pairplot and a correlation matrix were employed to see the relationship among the features. We also checked categorical features such as 'Sex' and 'Pclass' against 'Survived' to identify survival patterns. Overall, this exercise revealed patterns, missing values, and feature relevance for further modeling.
